# Array2DEditor

Use this if you want to deal with 2D arrays easily within the inspector of Unity.

## Getting Started

For a quick import into an existing project, just get the [UnityPackage](https://github.com/SyaoranChang/Array2DEditor/releases).

The Array2DEditor folder is an empty project with only the plugin imported and some examples! :)

Then, when you're in your project:

- Right click in your Project or Hierarchy window, or go to the Assets menu tab.
- Go to Create -> Array2D and select the type of your choice (_bool_, _int_, _float_, _string_).
- A new file is created, you can freely change its values!
- Reference that file in one of your scripts, and call its method GetCells() to get the content of the array.
- When you do this, don't forget to add _using Array2DEditor_ on top of your script.
- You can check the ExampleScene if you have trouble understanding how it works and how it can be useful.

## Going further

You can create your own enum files! In order to do that:
- Duplicate the *Array2DExampleEnum* script and rename it.
- Open the file and rename the class with the name of the file.
- Replace any mention of *Enums.ExampleEnum* with your own enum name.
- In that same file, don't forget to rename *CellRowExampleEnum* as well.

Then:
- Duplicate the *Array2DExampleEnumEditor* script and rename it.
- Open the file and rename the class with the name of the file.
- Replace *Enums.ExampleEnum* with your own enum name.
- You can change the values of *CellWidth* and *CellHeight* as you wish!
